**Objective

This report documents the methodology, tools, findings, and security analysis of publicly exposed cloud application assets associated with the University of California, Irvine (UCI). The goal is to map UCI’s cloud presence and identify potential risks.

Importance of Identifying UCI’s Cloud Services and Associated Domains
Understanding the cloud services that the University of California, Irvine (UCI) operates, along with their associated domains, is a critical step in assessing security, managing assets, and mitigating risks. This verification process ensures that the university maintains a secure and well-governed cloud infrastructure.

Security Assessment & Attack Surface Management
Identifying UCI’s cloud services helps uncover publicly exposed assets, which could be targeted by malicious actors. Misconfigured services, such as open databases, outdated applications, or improperly secured storage, can introduce significant vulnerabilities. Additionally, verifying cloud services helps detect unauthorized or unmanaged resources deployed by departments outside official IT oversight, reducing the risk of "shadow IT" and potential security breaches.

Cloud Asset Inventory & Governance Verification
A well-maintained asset inventory is essential for effective cloud governance. While organizations should keep track of their cloud services, independent verification ensures that no resources are overlooked. This process can also help identify forgotten or unused cloud assets that may pose security risks or result in unnecessary costs.

Risk Mitigation & Compliance
Many cloud services handle sensitive university data, including student records, research information, and financial data. Ensuring that these services are properly secured helps UCI comply with regulatory requirements such as FERPA, HIPAA, and GDPR. Furthermore, identifying domains associated with these services helps prevent phishing attacks and unauthorized access to university resources.

Cloud Provider Usage & Third-Party Dependencies
Determining which cloud providers host UCI’s services (such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud) allows for better security monitoring, budgeting, and compliance tracking. Additionally, identifying external SaaS platforms or third-party dependencies is crucial for assessing supply chain risks and ensuring that external services meet UCI’s security standards.

Business Continuity & Incident Response
A comprehensive understanding of UCI’s cloud services enables a faster response to security incidents and enhances disaster recovery planning. In the event of a breach, knowing where assets are hosted and which domains are affected is essential for timely remediation and containment of threats.

Conclusion
Even if UCI maintains an internal record of its cloud assets, independent verification is necessary to detect security risks, improve governance, and ensure regulatory compliance. Mapping these assets and their domains helps uncover misconfigurations, unauthorized services, and potential attack vectors, ultimately strengthening the university’s cybersecurity posture.
